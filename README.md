A Clojure gRPC client library for [Vald](https://github.com/vdaas/vald).

## Usage

To use this library, one of the following libraries is required.

- `io.grpc/grpc-okhttp`
- `io.grpc/grpc-netty`
- `io.grpc/grpc-netty-shaded`

```clojure
(require '[vald-client-clj.core :as vald])

;; vald gateway
(def client
  (vald/vald-client "localhost" 8081))

;; vald agent
(def agent-client
  (vald/agent-client "localhost" 8081))
;; NOTE:
;;   gateway and agent have same interfaces.
;;   These methods can also be used for agent client.

(-> client
    (vald/stream-insert
      println
      [{:id "meta1"
        :vector [0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6]}
       {:id "meta2"
        :vector [0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2]}])
    (deref))

(-> client
    (vald/get-object "meta1"))

(-> client
    (vald/stream-search-by-id println {:num 2} ["meta1" "meta2"])
    (deref))

(-> client
    (vald/search {:num 2} [0.1 0.2 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.4]))

(-> agent-client
    (vald/search {:num 2} [0.1 0.2 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.4]))

(vald/close client)
